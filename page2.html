  <p>Premier Cat Pics combines a free membership experience and curated products to create a new way to enjoy cat pics on the web.</p>
  <p>Members are able to submit, browse, and vote on cat pictures. The highest rated submission each month will be converted into limited edition products on sale for that month. Once sold out the product is gone for good.</p>
  <p>Revenue from products is split three ways: us, the cat pic submitter, and towards different cat related nonprofits. This allows us to give back to both our members and cats.</p>       
  <p>We encourage you to learn more about our member program!</p>
